The example above works using the Tailwind breakpoints, including an arbitrary one using `md-[arbitrary-value]`, customizing the design for different screen sizes.

We’ve only used few breakpoint in this example, but you could easily customize this component at other sizes using the `lg`, `xl`, or `2xl` responsive prefixes as well.
